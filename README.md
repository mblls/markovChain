In my newest implementation, I utilized Kaggle's repository of Netflix show/movie descriptions in order to get some funky new sentences. What's necessary now is to add some features to guarantee grammatical (or at the very least syntactical) errors are kept to a minimum. It should also be noted that the webscraper *no longer works* given that Twitter began obfruscating their code in order to push their API. I'm keeping the legacy web-scraper to demonstrate my own procifiency in developing a web-scraper (looking at you recruiters and hiring-managers ;) ).
